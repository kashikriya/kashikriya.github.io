								<p>Guruji is a 'Householder Yogi': a spiritual master who teaches Hatha Yoga for a living and has a family. He does not have an ashram, nor does he run a business or an organisation. He is an authorised master of Kriya Yoga in the direct lineage of the great Yogi Sri Lahiri Mahasaya, whose name became known worldwide through the publication of Autobiography of a Yogi by Paramahansa Yogananda.</p>
								<p>And if you saw Guruji tending to his plants and vegetables in the back garden, one of his favourite pastimes, you could be excused for imagining that he is an ordinary family man. Because there are no external signs to make you think twice, if you passed Guruji at the local market or on the street, you would never guess that many devotees and disciples around the world recognise in him something rare and wonderful, and go to extraordinary lengths to meet him, ask his advice, hear him speak and just to be close to him.</p>

									Kashi Kriya Yoga Centre is neither an organisation, nor is it an ashram. We receive no external funding. It is always appreciated when Disciples consider Guruji's time, and  understand that considerable expenses are involved in running the yoga centre. Donations are a practical way of giving, and they support Guruji's important work in this world. The spirit in which donations are given is also important and meaningful, hence the explanation of the Indian tradition below:</p>
									Guru Dakshina/Sewa
									Guru Dakshina/Sewa means an offering, or a gift to the Guru. Sewa means 'service'. From ancient times, it has always been understood as an essential part of the spiritual path for disciples to serve their Guru in some way. In ashrams, people work as a community, serving their Guru. This is because without 'surrender' (as meant in the entirely positive, self-enriching sense), progress on the spiritual path is very difficult. Therefore the physical expression is also important.
									When a Disciple gives Guru Dakshina, they are expressing their gratitude and love for what they have received on the spiritual path. It is an appreciation of the spiritual guidance which is always at hand. There is also an understanding that if we take and do not give in return, we may lose what we were given in the first place, having attached no value to it. Guru Dakshina/Sewa is always given with joy, and the act of giving invites grace.
									Spiritual teachings are given freely, for wisdom is priceless.  However, it is up to students to give a monetary donation to their Guru for their time and availability, and for their guidance. A Disciple arrives at an amount voluntarily, according to personal circumstances.
									Your gratitude is appreciated.
